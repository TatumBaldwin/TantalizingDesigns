        <h1>Blooming Botany Business Package</h1> 
        <p>This project is my very first business package. This is a busineess based on my own personal fictional character. Her name is Juniper Grey, she is a 45 year old who purchased a plant shop in Florida. In this story, Juniper has hired me to create her business. After many sketches and combining ideas, I finally came across this design. I decided that Juniper would mostly be selling succulents and some pot plants which inspired my design of a lotus and cactus.</p>
