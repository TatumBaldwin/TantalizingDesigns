        <h1>Art Nouveau Bike Poster</h1>
        <p> This project was assigned to me in my first year of graphic design. We were tasked with creating a bike poster in the style of Art Nouveau. I had a very hard time witht this design, which is the main reason why I showcase it. When I started the project, I had never drawn a bike before, and I was very nervous about getting it right. I was also still pretty new to the software so I wasn't sure about my capabilities. 
        Even with all of these complications, I still wanted to challenge myself and draw a beatiful girl on a bike (as beatiful women were very popular in Art Nouveau). After sketching her out, I created a fun background. I wanted the poster to relay that the beatiful woman on the bike was having fun, so I made the colors really light.   </p>
