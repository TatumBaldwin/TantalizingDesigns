    <h1>Bookmarks</h1>
    
    <p>I was tasked with creating a bookmark with Adobe Illustrator Shortcuts. We needed to have a minimum of five shortcuts and a specific color theme.
        It was near the time of Halloween so I decided to stick to the spooky theme. I have always been a fan of spooky designs so I instantly knew what I wanted to do. 
        I decided on a purple theme, since this is a bookmark, I want it to be able to be used year round, not just on Halloween. Then I sketched out a pose for my character so I could trace it in adobe. I have always loved the pumkin head designs, so I decided to go for it. 
        Once I was done with her pose, I added some blood stamps to give the design some motion.
